## Research interests

The Tal lab studies whether host-associated microbiota modify the developmental toxicity of environmental chemicals. The group also works to resolve how early life stage thyroid hormone disruption impacts brain development and function in zebrafish. 

## Education and Training

I study developmental vascular toxicity in zebrafish.
